## 1. Versioning scheme

YieldVault uses **URL path versioning** for the REST API:

```
https://<host>/api/<version>/<resource>
```

| Component | Example | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `<host>` | `api.yieldvault.io` | Varies by environment |
| `<version>` | `v1` | Integer-incremented: `v1`, `v2`, … |
| `<resource>` | `vault/summary` | Stable resource path within a version |

A full versioned endpoint looks like:

```
GET https://api.yieldvault.io/api/v1/vault/summary
```

### Why URL versioning?

URL versioning was chosen because:

- It is visible in access logs without parsing headers.
- Proxies, CDNs, and caches route on the path without special configuration.
- Testing in a browser or with `curl` requires no extra headers.

**Header-based versioning** (`Accept: application/vnd.yieldvault.v2+json`) is not
currently supported. Custom `X-API-Version` request headers are also ignored.

---

## 2. Current and supported versions

| Version | Status | Base path | Introduced | End-of-life |
|---------|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **v1** | **Active** (current) | `/api/v1` | 2026-03-28 | TBD |

Only one version is active at a time. New integrations must use the `v1` base path.

**Unversioned paths** (e.g., `/api/vault/summary`, `/auth/login`) are a legacy
transition layer that **redirects 301** to the `v1` equivalents. They are
subject to removal without a separate deprecation window once the transition
window closes (see [§ 6](#6-backward-compatibility-redirects)).

---

## 3. How versions are communicated

Every response from the versioned API includes an `X-API-Version` response header
indicating the version that handled the request:

```
X-API-Version: v1
```

This header is always present on `2xx`, `4xx`, and `5xx` responses. It is absent
only on infrastructure-level rejections (load balancer, TLS handshake failures)
that never reach the application server.

Integrators should log this header alongside `X-Correlation-ID` to aid in
debugging cross-version issues during migration periods.

---

## 4. Deprecation policy

### 4.1 Deprecation windows by change type

| Change type | Minimum notice | Minimum availability after notice |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Non-critical endpoint removal | 90 days | 90 days |
| Critical endpoint removal (auth, deposits, withdrawals) | 180 days | 180 days |
| Request field removal or rename | 90 days | 90 days |
| Response field removal or rename | 90 days | 90 days |
| Behavior change with backward-compatible fallback | 60 days | 60 days |
| Full version sunset (e.g., retiring `v1`) | 12 months | 12 months |

> **Emergency security deprecations** bypass the standard window. If a deprecated
> endpoint poses an active security risk (e.g., an exploitable authentication bypass),
> it may be disabled with as little as **7 days' notice** (or immediately, if
> exploitation is confirmed). A post-mortem and migration path will be published
> within 48 hours of any emergency removal.

### 4.2 Deprecation announcement channels

When an endpoint or field is deprecated, the following channels will carry the
announcement before the removal date:

1. **GitHub release notes** — deprecation listed under `### Deprecated` in the
   relevant `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
2. **Response headers** — `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers added to every
   response from the affected endpoint (see [§ 5](#5-deprecation-signals)).
3. **API documentation** — this document and the relevant endpoint doc are updated
   with a deprecation notice, the sunset date, and a migration path.
4. **Email notification** — integrators with registered API keys receive an email
   to the address on file at least 30 days before the sunset date.

### 4.3 What happens on the sunset date

On the sunset date the deprecated endpoint responds with `410 Gone`:

```json
{
  "error": "Gone",
  "status": 410,
  "message": "This endpoint was sunset on <ISO date>. Migrate to <replacement path>.",
  "migrateToPath": "/api/v1/<replacement>"
}
```

The `410` response is served for a **30-day grace window** after the announced
sunset date to help clients that missed the deadline. After the grace window, the
route is removed and unknown paths return the standard `404 Not Found`.

---

## 5. Deprecation signals

### 5.1 `Deprecation` header

The `Deprecation` header follows
[RFC 8594](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8594) and is set on every response
from a deprecated endpoint:

```
Deprecation: Sat, 30 Sep 2026 00:00:00 GMT
```

The date is the **sunset date** — the day the endpoint stops accepting requests.

When an endpoint is deprecated indefinitely (no sunset date yet confirmed),
the header carries the boolean form:

```
Deprecation: true
```

### 5.2 `Sunset` header

The `Sunset` header (also [RFC 8594](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8594))
carries the same date as `Deprecation` when a firm sunset date is set:

```
Sunset: Sat, 30 Sep 2026 00:00:00 GMT
```

### 5.3 `Link` header (migration hint)

A `Link` header pointing to the replacement endpoint and this policy document is
added alongside the deprecation headers:

```
Link: </api/v1/vault/summary>; rel="successor-version",
      </docs/api/VERSIONING.md>; rel="deprecation"
```

### 5.4 Example: full deprecation response headers

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-API-Version: v1
Deprecation: Sat, 30 Sep 2026 00:00:00 GMT
Sunset: Sat, 30 Sep 2026 00:00:00 GMT
Link: </api/v1/vault/summary>; rel="successor-version", </docs/api/VERSIONING.md>; rel="deprecation"
X-Correlation-ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

Integrators should monitor for the presence of the `Deprecation` header and alert
their teams when it appears on a response.

---

## 6. Backward-compatibility redirects

During the initial migration from unversioned to versioned paths, the server issues
**`301 Moved Permanently`** redirects from legacy paths to their `v1` equivalents.

| Legacy path (deprecated) | Canonical path | Notes |
|--------------------------|---------------|-------|
| `POST /auth/login` | `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | — |
| `POST /auth/refresh` | `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` | — |
| `POST /auth/logout` | `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` | — |
| `POST /auth/logout-all` | `POST /api/v1/auth/logout-all` | — |
| `GET /api/vault/summary` | `GET /api/v1/vault/summary` | `Deprecation: true` set |
| `GET /api/vault/metrics` | `GET /api/v1/vault/metrics` | — |
| `GET /api/vault/apy` | `GET /api/v1/vault/apy` | — |
| `GET /api/vault/transactions/export` | `GET /api/v1/vault/transactions/export` | — |
| `POST /webhooks/verify` | `POST /api/v1/webhooks/verify` | — |
| `GET/POST /vault/*` | `/api/v1/vault/*` | Catch-all redirect |
| `GET/POST /referrals/*` | `/api/v1/referrals/*` | Catch-all redirect |
| `GET/POST /transactions/*` | `/api/v1/transactions/*` | Catch-all redirect |
| `GET/POST /portfolio/*` | `/api/v1/portfolio/*` | Catch-all redirect |

### Redirect behavior notes

- HTTP clients that follow redirects automatically (most HTTP libraries) will reach
  the canonical endpoint transparently. The `301` status signals that clients
  **must update their stored URLs** — the redirect is not permanent infrastructure.
- `POST` redirects: some HTTP clients downgrade `POST` to `GET` on a `301`. If you
  experience unexpected `GET` requests reaching the versioned endpoint, use
  `307 Temporary Redirect` semantics by updating your base URL instead.
- The redirect layer will be removed once the transition window closes (no earlier
  than **90 days** after the first `Deprecation` header appears on those paths).
  Clients relying on redirects will start receiving `404 Not Found` at that point.

---

## 7. What constitutes a breaking change

A breaking change requires a new API version. The following are always breaking:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Removing an endpoint | Deleting `GET /api/v1/vault/summary` |
| Renaming an endpoint | `/api/v1/vault/metrics` → `/api/v1/vault/stats` |
| Removing a required or optional request field | Removing `walletAddress` from transaction filters |
| Removing a response field that was previously always present | Removing `pagination.total` from list responses |
| Narrowing an accepted value range | Changing max `limit` from 100 to 50 |
| Changing an HTTP method | `GET /vault/apy` → `POST /vault/apy` |
| Changing an HTTP status code to a semantically different class | `200` → `202 Accepted` for vault deposits |
| Adding a required request field | Making `walletAddress` mandatory on an endpoint where it was optional |
| Changing authentication requirements | Adding auth to a previously open endpoint |
| Changing error response shape in a way that breaks existing parsers | Renaming `error` → `errorCode` in the error body |

---

## 8. Non-breaking changes (safe to ship without a new version)

The following changes may be made to `v1` without bumping to `v2`:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Adding a new optional request field | New optional `assetFilter` query param |
| Adding a new response field | Adding `sharePrice` to vault summary |
| Adding a new endpoint | New `GET /api/v1/vault/strategy` endpoint |
| Relaxing an accepted value range | Raising max `limit` from 100 to 200 |
| Adding a new HTTP status code for a new error condition | Adding `451` for geofenced users on a new endpoint |
| Adding new optional response headers | New `X-RateLimit-Policy` header |
| Correcting documentation | Fixing a typo or misleading example |
| Performance improvements with identical input/output contracts | Query optimization, caching |
| Adding enum values that clients are expected to pass through or ignore | New `type` value in transaction list |

When in doubt, assume a change is breaking and version it.

## 9. Client migration guide

### 9.1 Detecting an active deprecation

Check every response for the `Deprecation` header:

```ts
const response = await fetch('https://api.yieldvault.io/api/v1/vault/summary');

if (response.headers.get('Deprecation')) {
  const sunsetDate = response.headers.get('Sunset');
  console.warn(
    `[YieldVault] Deprecated endpoint called. Sunset: ${sunsetDate ?? 'TBD'}. ` +
    `See Link header for the replacement.`
  );
}
```

Log the `Sunset` date in your monitoring dashboard and create a migration task before
that date.

### 9.2 Updating from an unversioned to a versioned base URL

Replace any unversioned base URLs in your HTTP client configuration:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `https://api.yieldvault.io/auth/login` | `https://api.yieldvault.io/api/v1/auth/login` |
| `https://api.yieldvault.io/api/vault/summary` | `https://api.yieldvault.io/api/v1/vault/summary` |
| `https://api.yieldvault.io/transactions` | `https://api.yieldvault.io/api/v1/transactions` |

If you use a centralized HTTP client or base URL constant, update it once:

```ts
// Before
const BASE = 'https://api.yieldvault.io';

// After
const BASE = 'https://api.yieldvault.io/api/v1';
```

### 9.3 Migrating to a new major version (v1 → v2)

When a new major version is released:

1. **Read the changelog** — the `v2` entry under `## [x.y.z]` in `CHANGELOG.md`
   will list every breaking change and the replacement path for each removed endpoint.
2. **Run both versions in parallel** — during the overlap window you can test your
   client against `v2` while continuing to serve users on `v1`.
3. **Update your base URL** — swap `v1` for `v2` in your HTTP client configuration.
4. **Handle new required fields** — any new required request fields are listed in
   the changelog. Validate your request payloads against the `v2` schema before
   switching.
5. **Drop `v1` after migration** — once you verify `v2` is working in production,
   remove any `v1` fallback paths from your client to avoid accidentally hitting
   deprecated behavior.

### 9.4 Handling `410 Gone`

After a sunset date, deprecated endpoints return `410 Gone`. Ensure your HTTP
client does not silently retry `410` responses:

```ts
if (response.status === 410) {
  const body = await response.json();
  throw new Error(
    `[YieldVault] Endpoint has been retired. ` +
    `Migrate to: ${body.migrateToPath}. Message: ${body.message}`
  );
}
```

### 9.5 Staying informed

- **Watch** the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Junirezz/YieldVault-RWA)
  for release announcements.
- **Subscribe** to the `#api-updates` channel if your organization has access.
- **Register an API key** so your contact email receives sunset notices
  (see `POST /admin/api-keys/register` in the API documentation).

---

## 10. Version lifecycle stages

Each API version moves through the following stages:

```
Development → Active → Deprecated → Sunset → Retired
```

| Stage | Description | Response headers |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Development** | Pre-release; available on staging only. Not suitable for production. | `X-API-Version: vN-dev` |
| **Active** | Current production version. All new features land here. | `X-API-Version: vN` |
| **Deprecated** | Successor version exists. Sunset date announced. Existing integrations continue to work. | `Deprecation`, `Sunset`, `Link` added |
| **Sunset** | Past sunset date. Endpoint returns `410 Gone` with migration path. | `410 Gone` body with `migrateToPath` |
| **Retired** | Route removed. Unknown path returns `404 Not Found`. | Standard `404` |

### Version overlap guarantee

When a new major version (`v2`) becomes **Active**, the previous version (`v1`)
will remain **Active** for at least **12 months** before transitioning to
**Deprecated**. This gives all integrators a full year to migrate.

The overlap timeline:

```
v1 Active ──────────────────────────────────┐
                                             ├─ v1 Deprecated (min. 6 months) ─┐
v2 Active ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
                                                                                 └─ v1 Sunset
```

## 11. FAQ

**Q: Can I pin to a specific minor version (e.g., `/api/v1.2`)?**

No. Minor versions are not surfaced in the URL. Within `v1`, all non-breaking
additions are deployed continuously. If a specific response shape is critical to
your integration, validate defensively (check field presence before reading) rather
than relying on a frozen snapshot.

---

**Q: Will you ever ship a breaking change inside `v1`?**

Only for active security vulnerabilities where the risk of keeping the behavior
outweighs the migration cost. In that case, a 7-day emergency notice will be issued
(see [§ 4.1](#41-deprecation-windows-by-change-type)). All other breaking changes go
into a new major version.

---

**Q: How do I know which version an error came from?**

Check `X-API-Version` on the response. It is present on all `4xx` and `5xx`
responses as well as `2xx`.

---

**Q: I'm seeing `Deprecation: true` but no `Sunset` header. When will it be removed?**

A sunset date has not yet been confirmed. The `Deprecation: true` header is an
early signal that the path is in the queue for retirement. A `Sunset` date will be
announced at least 90 days before removal. Migrate at your earliest opportunity.

---

**Q: What if I call an already-sunsetted endpoint?**

You will receive a `410 Gone` response with a `migrateToPath` field pointing to
the canonical replacement. The `410` response is served for 30 days after the
official sunset date, after which the route is removed and returns `404 Not Found`.

---

**Q: Are webhook event schemas versioned separately?**

Webhook payload schemas follow the same versioning rules as REST responses. The
`api_version` field in every webhook event body indicates which schema version
generated the payload. See [WEBHOOK_INTEGRATION.md](../WEBHOOK_INTEGRATION.md)
for webhook-specific migration guidance.

---

**Q: Are Soroban contract interfaces covered by this policy?**

No. The Soroban contract interface is governed separately — on-chain contracts are
immutable once deployed, so upgrades require a new contract deployment and a
protocol-level migration. See
[docs/runbooks/CONTRACT_UPGRADE_PLAYBOOK.md](../runbooks/CONTRACT_UPGRADE_PLAYBOOK.md)
for the contract upgrade process.
