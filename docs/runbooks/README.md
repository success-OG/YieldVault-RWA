## Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to select the appropriate runbook:

```
Is the entire infrastructure down?
├─ YES → Use Full DR Procedure
└─ NO → Continue

Is the database corrupted or inaccessible?
├─ YES → Use Database Restore
└─ NO → Continue

Is the backend service down or malfunctioning?
├─ YES → Use Backend Redeploy
└─ NO → Continue

Is the Stellar RPC node failing?
├─ YES → Use RPC Failover
└─ NO → Are ledger events lagging or email queue jobs failing?
        ├─ YES → Use Replay & State Recovery
        └─ NO → Check component-specific documentation
```
